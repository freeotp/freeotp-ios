# FreeOTP

[FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) is a two-factor authentication application for systems
utilizing one-time password protocols. Tokens can be added easily by scanning a QR code.

FreeOTP implements open standards:

* HOTP (HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) [RFC 4226](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt)
* TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) [RFC 6238](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt)

This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary: use any server-side component
that implements these standards.

## Download FreeOTP for iOS

* [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freeotp-authenticator/id872559395?mt=8)
